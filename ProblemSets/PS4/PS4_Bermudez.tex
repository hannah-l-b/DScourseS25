\section{Web Scrapping Interests \& Data Sources}
\hspace*{2em} It would be interesting to scrape Twitter/X or Reddit to see what people are saying about different animes and video games. I know fandoms have distinct ways of discussing their favorite characters, from intense debates over character development to sharing fan theories, memes, and fan art. It would be cool to track the frequency of discussions over time, especially in relation to new content releases, updates, or major plot events, to see how engagement spikes and shifts across different fandoms. \\

I'd also be interested in compiling a list of classic literature from Project Gutenberg and analyzing the texts for themes, linguistic patterns, and shifts in literary styles over time, as well as conducting sentiment analysis to explore how emotions are conveyed across different periods and authors. It'd be fascinating to see at what point certain themes or motifs become more prominent in literature, reflecting societal changes, historical events, or shifts in cultural values over time.
